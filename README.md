Part of a project that has a basic sku image for a product.  We needed to add various "alternate" images and views to the same product, as well as create a simple xml feed that can be created on command and retrieved by a 3rd party to input into their software.  Upon upload, the program saves the original image, resizes for a large copy, and resizes for a thumbnail.
